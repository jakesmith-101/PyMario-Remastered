# async function for each "game" loop:
# menu loop
# gameplay loop
# pause loop

# these loops shouldn't "affect" each other much and can be ran simultaneously

# classes and succession? entity, block, projectile, etc

# sprites or draw? since stick figures can be constructed out of shapes and animated
