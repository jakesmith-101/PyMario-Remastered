async function for each "game" loop:
- menu loop
- gameplay loop
- pause loop

these loops shouldn't "affect" each other much and can be ran simultaneously
<br />
classes and succession? entity, block, projectile, etc
<br />
sprites or draw? since stick figures can be constructed out of shapes and animated
